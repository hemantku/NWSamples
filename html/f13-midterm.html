        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2013 - Midterm Assignment</H2>

        <H3>Midterm Assignment: Implement ls(1)</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to write a
        significant system tool from scratch.  In doing so, you will learn
        many details of the UNIX filesystem and the general system
        concepts we have covered in class.
	</p>
	<h4>Problem assignment</h4>
	<p>
	Implement the ls(1) command as described in the manual page provided to
	you <a href="ls.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>
	<P>
	Please note that this manual page describes a subset of the options
	available on most systems, so please make sure to consult only this page
	as reference.
	</p>
	<P>
	Your program must follow the <a href="hw">general homework guidelines</a>.
	</p>
	<P>
	Your code should be easily readable and contain comments <b>where
	necessary</b>.
	You should look at <a href="style">this file</a> for
	examples of good coding style.  Follow these guidelines!
	</p>
	<p>
	It is a good idea to make use of a <em>revision control
	system</em>, such as <a
	href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, <a
	href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> or <a
	href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> to allow you
	to better track your progress.  Please feel free to set up or use
	any existing repository you already make use of, such as on <a
	href="https://github.com/">github</a>, for example.
        Often it also makes sense to split
	functionality across separate files; you probably do not want to
	submit all code in a single file.
	</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<h5>Snapshot</H5>
	<p>
	You must submit a compilable and working snapshot of
	your project by 2013-09-30, at 16:00.  By then, you should have
	implemented some basic functionality and some of the command-line
	options.  It does not need to work without errors or bugs, but it
	shouldn't segfault either; it should just show that you are making progress.
	Failure to submit the snapshot on time will result in a 10% deduction
	from the grade for the midterm project.
	</p>

	<h5>Final submission</h5>
	<p>You will submit a single <tt>tar</tt> archive named
	<em>username</em>-midterm.tar that will extract
	into a directory named after your username.  In that directory
	will be at least a file named <tt>ls.c</tt> and an optional Makefile.
	If you have any commentary on your
	submission, include it in a file called <tt>README</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	For example, I would submit the file <tt>jschauma-midterm.tar</tt>
	which might and compile as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
	<verbatim><tt><pre>
$ tar xvf jschauma-midterm.tar
jschauma
jschauma/Makefile
jschauma/README
jschauma/cmp.c
jschauma/ls.h
jschauma/ls.c
jschauma/print.h
jschauma/print.c
$ cd jschauma
$ make
$
	</pre></tt></verbatim></p>
           <p>
             The due date for this assignment is 2013-10-15 16:00.  Please
             attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
             email address to <a
             href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] midterm">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
             with a subject of "[CS631] midterm".
           </p>

	<h5>Extra Credit</h5>
	<p>For 15 extra credit points, implement the "<tt>-C</tt>" option
	("Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal."),
	which nicely formats the output similar to the way the OS provided
	version of ls(1) does.</p>
	<p>For 5 extra credit points, implement the "<tt>-x</tt>" option
	("The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced with
	entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.").</p>
	<p>Both of these options take the <tt>COLUMNS</tt> environment
	variable into account.</p>
