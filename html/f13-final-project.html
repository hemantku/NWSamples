        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2013 - Final Project</H2>

        <H3>Final Project: Write a simple web server</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to write a simple
	web server that speaks a limited version of HTTP/1.0 as defined in
	<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt">RFC1945</a>.  This
	gives you occasion to understand the process of reading an RFC and
	implementing a well-known protocol.
	</p>
	<p>You will implement the
	<tt>sws(1)</tt> command as described in the manual page provided
	to you <a href="sws.1.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	As usual, the <a href="hw">general homework guidelines</a> apply.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is a non-trivial programming assignment -- do not postpone
	starting to work on this!  Try to first get the basics right, then
	add functionality one by one, always ensuring that the added code
	did not break any previous functionality.  If you're stuck, describe
	your problem on the mailing list.
	</p>
	<h5>Additional considerations</h5>
	<p>
	Please carefully read <a
	href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt">RFC1945</a> to understand
	version 1.0 of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
	Please carefully read <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875">RFC3875</a>
	to understand the Common Gateway Interface.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your program should behave as one would expect from a regular system
	daemon. That is, it should detach from the controlling terminal and
	run in the background, accept multiple simultaneous connections, not
	generate any messages on stdout unless in debugging mode etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your program does have to return normal HTTP/1.0 status codes as
	described in the RFC.
	</p>
	<p>Your program does NOT <em>need</em> to support the POST method.</p>
	<p>Your program does NOT <em>need</em> to support logging.</p>
	<h5>Extra Credit</h5>
	<p>The following are ways to gain extra-credit.  Please only start
	working on these features if you are satisfied with the basic
	functionality.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Implementing support for logging: +10</li>
	  <li>Implementing support for POST: +30</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a tar archive of all your files, including a
	Makefile, since surely you do not write all your code in a single
	file.
        <p>
        The due date for this assignment is 2013-12-16 10:59:59.  Please
        attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
        email address to <a
        href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] final project">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
        with a subject of "[CS631] final project".
