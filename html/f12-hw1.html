        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2011 - HW#1</H2>

        <H3>HW#1: code reading</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to get used to
	read (and understand!) code.  To this end, please take a look at
	the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/bin/">NetBSD
	source code for programs installed under /bin</a>, pick two
	programs of your liking and inspect the code.  Then, read the
	corresponding code of the same programs in Linux or Open Solaris.
	Compare the different implementations.  What do they have in
	common? What makes them different?</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a single plain text file created with a unix
	text editor on a unix system called "HW1-&lt;username&gt;" (where
	"&lt;username&gt;" is your Stevens username).  In
	that file write down (<em>in proper English, spell-checked and with
	valid grammar</em>) which programs you compared, how you chose them,
	how you retrieved the source code to the programs in question
	and what you have found out about the implementations.</p>
	<p>
	The due date for this assignment is 2012-09-10 18:15.  Please
	attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
	email address to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] HW1">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS631] HW1".
	</p>
	<h4>Follow the instructions!</h4>
	<p>Please note that following these instructions is part of the
	assignment and not doing so can lead to points being taken off.
	(Consider a previous semester's <a
	href="http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/615A/s11-hw5.html">embarassing
	 but very necessary assignment</a>!)</p>
