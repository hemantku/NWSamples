        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2013 - HW#1</H2>

        <H3>HW#1: code reading</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to get used to
	read (and understand!) code.  To this end, please take a look at
	the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/bin/">NetBSD
	source code for programs installed under /bin</a>, pick two
	programs of your liking and inspect the code.  Then, read the
	corresponding code of the same programs in <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/">Linux</a>
	or <strike>Open Solaris</strike> <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/tree/master/usr/src">Illumos</a>.
	Compare the different implementations.  What do they have in
	common? What makes them different?</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a single plain text file created with a unix
	text editor on a unix system called "HW1-&lt;username&gt;" (where
	"&lt;username&gt;" is your Stevens username).  In
	that file write down (<em>in proper English, spell-checked and with
	valid grammar</em>) which programs you compared, how you chose them,
	how you retrieved the source code to the programs in question
	and what you have found out about the implementations.</p>
	<p>
	The due date for this assignment is 2013-09-09 16:00.  Please
	attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
	email address to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] HW1">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS631] HW1".
	</p>
	<h4>Follow the instructions!</h4>
	<p>Please note that following these instructions is part of the
	assignment and not doing so can lead to points being taken off.
	(Consider a previous semester's <a
	href="http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/615A/s11-hw5.html">embarassing
	but very necessary assignment</a>!)</p>
