        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2012 - HW#4</H2>

        <H3>HW#4: yes, even more code reading</H3>

<h4>Problem Assignment</h4>
<p>It is important to be able to read other people's code.  Sometimes that
code is beautiful, well-written, clear and correct; other times, it is
buggy, difficult to understand and convoluted.  We don't always have a
choice in which code we want to read and have to understand.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, you will each review and grade one of your classmate's
midterm submissions.  In the directory</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/hw4/">http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/hw4/</a></p>

<p>you will find a file with your username.  Download that file and then
evaluate the submission as if you were the instructor.  That is, read the
code, comment on the good, the bad and the ugly parts; execute the program
and verify that all functionality is present and the program works as
expected and required.</p>

<p>At the end, determine an appropriate grade for the code in question --
make sure to justify your grade based on your findings.</p>

	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a single plain text file, as usual.</p>
        <p>
        The due date for this assignment is 2012-11-19 18:15.  Please
        attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
        email address to <a
        href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] HW4">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
        with a subject of "[CS631] HW4".
